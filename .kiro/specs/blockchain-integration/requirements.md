# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for upgrading the LokiAI autonomous trading system from a simulation-based platform to a fully functional, production-level blockchain-integrated trading platform. The system will connect all four AI agents (Arbitrage Bot, Yield Optimizer, Risk Manager, and Portfolio Rebalancer) to real blockchain networks and smart contracts, eliminating all mock data and simulations.

## Glossary

- **LokiAI_System**: The complete autonomous trading platform including frontend, backend, and AI agents
- **Blockchain_Layer**: The core infrastructure for connecting to Ethereum and supported chains (Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum)
- **AI_Agent**: Individual trading bots (Arbitrage Bot, Yield Optimizer, Risk Manager, Portfolio Rebalancer)
- **Smart_Contract**: On-chain programs that execute trading logic and manage assets
- **DeFi_Protocol**: Decentralized finance platforms like Uniswap, Aave, Curve for trading and yield farming
- **RPC_Provider**: Blockchain node service providers (Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode)
- **Wallet_Service**: MetaMask integration for user transactions and server-side private key management
- **Event_Listener**: Backend service that monitors blockchain events and contract interactions
- **Notification_Service**: Real-time alert system using Telegram, Discord, and Gmail
- **Socket_Service**: WebSocket connection for real-time frontend updates
